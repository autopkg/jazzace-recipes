	<string>Downloads the latest version of the Epson SureColor P700/P900 driver from Epson's site.
For other Epson drivers, use the EpsonProDriver.download recipe.

An override is required. The homebysix-recipes repo is also required.

IMPORTANT:
This recipe requires that you find the support page for the SureColor P800 (yes, not the P700 or P900)
and copy that URL for use as the base string for the P800_SEARCH_URL key in your override.
This is because Epson no longer reveals the driver download alone for the P700 or P900 on their
support website, even though their app-based installer downloads it. The driver is the same for
both printers, so this recipe uses known patterns to grab the P800 driver download path and
modify it to point to the P700/P900 driver download.

In order for the recipe to work, the target OS must be explicitly specified in the P800_SEARCH_URL.
The Epson Canada URL for the P800 is supplied as the default.

Recommended Procedure for Creating URL:
1. Go to the Epson site for your country.
2. Find the support page for the Epson SureColor P800.
3. The support page will attempt to determine your current OS version and will display that
in a pop-up menu on the page. If that is OS you are targeting for deployment, temporarily
change the value in that popup menu to any other OS, wait a second (enough for the page to
quickly reload), and then change to the OS you are targeting for deployment. If you are
targeting a different OS, then directly change the OS in the popup menu.
4. Copy the URL.
5. Create an override of this recipe (or edit an existing override).
6. In the Input section, paste the URL that you copied earlier into the string for P800_SEARCH_URL.
7. Check the URL you just pasted. Confirm that it ends with something that looks like
the following:
    ?review-filter=macOS+13.x
(substituting the number of the major macOS version as appropriate).
You can append this string if it is not present.
